# Datasource properties
# For H2 use this URL for the in memory version 
# jdbc:h2:mem:test;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
# And this one for the remote version e.g. in docker
# jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:1521/test
# This command will start a docker H2 image when using a the remote H2 URL above.
# docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -p 81:81 -e H2_OPTIONS='-ifNotExists' --name=h2 oscarfonts/h2

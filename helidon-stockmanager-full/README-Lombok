Lombok is a jar file that contains a bunch of annotation definitions and supporting compile time code
The key thing it does is to do things automatically that you would otherwise have to do by hand, for 
example using Lomboks @Data annotation on a class will automatically generate getters, setters equals, 
hashcode and toString method for you. This saves a lot of time and even better as they are automatically 
generated at compile time as you modify a classes fields all of the methods are automatically updated for 
you, no more finding something has been forgotten

Lombok is included in the JARs as it's specified in the Mavan pom.xml file, however as Lombok needs to 
be called at compiler time it also needs to be included in the IDE you're using.

Fortunately Lombok has an installation option, locate the Lombok jar file and run it. It will bring up a 
UI that (with your permission) allows it to locate and install itself in the IDE's

If you want to download the Lombok jar file by hand you can do so at https://projectlombok.org/
